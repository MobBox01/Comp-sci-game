Each board has a [0] [1] and [2]
[0] - Black void mass
[1] - Terrain
[2] - Movable areas
[3] - Save Point (may not be implemented)
[4] - Next room

Board -> 10x10 (Planned) OR 5x5 easier to build map
7x7 Board in use!


To be considered later:
[ENCOUNTER] will not happen, instead its all RNG
[Steps] -> Each time a play steps it will choose a direction, wont go previous location until previous is smth else
Enemy moves up, cant move down until next step
Once moved differently it can go back to spot
